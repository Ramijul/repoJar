				<p>
				I tried to avoid inline html. It makes it hard to read and maintain. Thus, I had seperate php files
				 consisting of html code. For javascript in the Employee History page, I added some script at the bottom 
				 of the html code. This allowed me to run the run the javascript code after the page has been completely 
				 loaded, since most of the javascript needs to be run right when the page is loaded.</p>
				
				<h3>User Documentation:</h3>
				<p>The navigation bar allows you to navigate to any page at any point in time. However, while saving data 
				you have to make sure that you enter the data correctly as instructed. Otherwise you will get invalid input 
				errors messages. You can also go to the Resume at any point (after saving data from atleast one page) to view 
				the progress.

				<h3>Technical description:</h3>
				<p>Since we weren't informed how to validate the phone number, I took the liberty to validate in such a way 
				that it will accept only 10 digits long nubmers (123-123-1234). However, I did not validate to have proper
				area codes.</p>
